## 🚨 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: "Patient with phone number already exists"
**Solution:** 
- This is GOOD! It prevents duplicate entries
- Choose **"Use Existing Patient"** if it's the same person
- Choose **"Add Anyway"** only if it's truly a different person

### Problem: "Please enter a valid 10-digit phone number"
**Solution:**
- Phone numbers must be exactly 10 digits
- Remove spaces, dashes, or parentheses
- Example: Use `9876543210` not `98765-43210`

### Problem: Can't find a patient
**Solutions:**
1. Try searching by phone number instead of name
2. Check spelling of name
3. Use "All Patients" to browse the complete list
4. Patient might be registered under a different name variation

### Problem: Visit count seems wrong
**Solution:**
- Visit count is accurate based on recorded visits
- If it seems low, previous visits might not have been recorded in the system
- You can still add new visits normally

### Problem: App won't start
**Solutions:**
1. Make sure the `.bat` file exists
2. Try running as administrator (right-click → "Run as administrator")
3. Check that no other instance is running
4. Restart your computer and try again
